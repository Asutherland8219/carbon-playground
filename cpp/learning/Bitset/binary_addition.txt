We can also do binary/bit addition. Though while it seems difficult it is quite easy once you get 
the hang of it.

Lets take two decimal numbers and convert them to binary; 6 and 7 

6 -> 0110
7 -> 0111

When you conduct addition, there are only 4 possible outcomes:

0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 0, carry the 1 

 0110   We will do it like this because columnar addition is easier to visualize this way
+0111
