We can also do binary/bit addition. Though while it seems difficult it is quite easy once you get 
the hang of it.

Lets take two decimal numbers and convert them to binary; 6 and 7 

6 -> 0110
7 -> 0111

When you conduct addition, there are only 4 possible outcomes:

0 + 0 = 0
0 + 1 = 1
1 + 0 = 1
1 + 1 = 0, carry the 1 

 0110   We will do it like this because columnar addition is easier to visualize this way
+0111

With addition we move from left to right:
Column 4: 0 + 1 = 1
Column 3: 1 + 1 = 0 carry 1
Column 2: 1 + 1 = 1 carry 1 
Column 1: 0 + 0 = 1 but 1 carry so 1

then because we go left from right we have to return the response bottom up

The value becomes 1101

We can actually check this by looking at the decimal return;
1101 is 13 in decimal which is 6 + 7

We can also handle signed integers and convert them to binary. 
For example, say we have -76

First we return the positive value of -76:

76 = 0100 1100

Then we invert that value:
    1011 0011

Finally, we add 1 

1011 0011
0000 0001

1011 0100  == -76
