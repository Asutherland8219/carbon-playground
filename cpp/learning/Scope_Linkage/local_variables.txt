Local variabls are variable that are limited within a local space. 

Local variables also have block scope, meaning they are in scope with the block they are defined within. 

Variable names within a scope must be unique and cannot be ambiguous.

Variables that are created within a block are deleted outside of a block. 

Identifiers have another property called linkage. The linkage determines whether other declarations of that name refer to 
the same object or not. 

Local variabls, have no linkage. 

While scope and linkage seem similar, "scope defines where a single declaration can be seen and used. 
Linkage defines whether multiple declarations refer to the same object or not."

Variables should be defined in the most limited scope; if it is only used in the block, it should be defined in the block.
Think CRUD and DRY principles.
