A compound statement, also called a block or block statement is a group of zero or more statements that is treated as a single statement. 

Think similar to class methods in python or a class with multiple defined functions. 

Blocks can be nested inside of one another. Creating both an outer block and inner block concept. 

Blocks, mainly, are used to handle if statements or logic gates.

When dealing with nesting, you get nesting level or neseting depth. If you 4 blocks total, 3 of which are nested then your nesting level is 3. We typically 
do not count the outer block when counting the nesting level. 

In C++, most compilers support up to 256 levels of nesting (LOL)...
For readability in everyday code however, it is best practice to keep nesting to around 3 levels.
